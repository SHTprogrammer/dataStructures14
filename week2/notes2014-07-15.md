## Answering questions about Homework 1:

For the Ractangle problem, can assume Rectangle dimensions are integers and can pass test rectangles as hard-coded

For Weiss problem 2.15, do not assume the integers in the array are positive -- can be negative or zero

For Weiss problem 2.7, for part a) give O() notation answer
For part b) give empirical answer

Weiss question 2.6: do not need to provide a proof

README in your zip should address implementation

## More Abstract Data Types

##Queue

> FIFO

How to implement?

### Linked List (Singly or Doubly)

For example, Singly Linked List:

> Two operations, enqueue and dequeue

> If adding to front end, enqueue is O(1)

> Then remvoving must happen at back end and be O(n)

(SLL has no tail node)

Doubly Linked List:

> Enqueue = O(1)

> Dequeue = O(1)

### Array

Front and tail pointers point to locations in array

When you add element, tail pointer moves over

When you remove element, head pointer moves over

If you run out of space, then wrap around to the front and use 
the space there

Use a size variable to keep track of stuff in the array, because you 
can't use indices to keep track of size anymore
