1. Weiss, Exercise 2.1
>>>Order the following functions by growth rate: N, √N, N1.5, N2, NlogN,
>>> N log log N, N log2 N, N log(N2), 2/N, 2N, 2N/2, 37, N2 log N, N3.
>>> Indicate which functions grow at the same rate.



2. Weiss, Exercise 2.6
>>>In a recent court case, a judge cited a city for contempt and ordered a
>>> fine of $2 for the first day. Each subsequent day, until the city 
>>>followed the judge’s order, the fine was squared (that is, the fine 
>>>progressed as follows: $2, $4, $16, $256, $65, 536, . . .).
>>>a. What would be the fine on day N?




>>>b. How many days would it take the fine to reach D dollars? 
>>>(A Big-Oh answer will do.)



3. Weiss, Exercise 2.7 - note that part b of this problem is actually 
  part of the programming assignment. Place your answers to part a, 
  and part c in the written solutions.

>>> For each of the following six program fragments:
>>> a. Give an analysis of the running time (Big-Oh will do).

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)


>>> b. Implement the code in Java, and give the running time for several 
>>> values of N. 

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)


>>>c. Compare your analysis with the actual running times.



4. Weiss, Exercise 2.10 (part a)
>>> Determine, for the typical algorithms that you use to perform calculations
>>> by hand, the running time to do the following:
>>> a. Add two N-digit integers.




5. Weiss, Exercise 2.11

>>> An algorithm takes 0.5 ms for input size 100. How long will it take 
>>> for input size 500 if the running time is the following (assume low-order
>>> terms are negligible): 
>>> a. linear


>>> b. O(NlogN)



>>> c. quadratic 


>>> d. cubic

6. Weiss, Exercise 2.15 
>>> Give an efficient algorithm to determine if there exists an integer
>>> i such that Ai = i in an array of integers A1 < A2 < A3 <···< AN.
>>> What is the running time of your algorithm?
