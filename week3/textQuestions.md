empty AVL tree._








### 2. Weiss, Exercise 4.31

_Write efficient methods that take only a reference to the root of a 
binary tree, T, and compute:_

_a. The number of nodes in T._






_b. The number of leaves in T._







_c. The number of full nodes in T._




_What is the running time of your routines?_




### 3. Prove that given a preorder and a postorder traversal of a binary 
tree, the tree cannot be uniquely reconstructed. 


### 4. Weiss, Exercise 5.1 

_Given input {4371, 1323, 6173, 4199, 4344, 9679, 1989} and a hash function 
h(x) = x mod 10, show the resulting:_

_a. Separate chaining hash table._

_b. Hash table using linear probing._

_c. Hash table using quadratic probing._

_d. Hash table with second hash function h2(x) = 7 âˆ’ (x mod 7)._


### 5. Weiss, Exercise 5.2 - Use a new table size of 19, adjust the hash 
function accordingly.
