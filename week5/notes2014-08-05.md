Have vertices with edges marking the conncetions between vertices

graph(V, E) (vertices, edges)

Graphs come in two varieties, directed and undirected (can go both ways 
or one way)

You can have vertices that have loops (edge that goes back to itself), but
we will not look at looped graphs

All the vertices are distinct in a Simple Path, except the first and the last
will be the same

Undirected graphs are Connected if every vertex has a path to every other vertex
Strongly connected if there's a path from each vertex to every other vertex
If a graph would be connected if it were not directed, it is weakly connected

Fully connected -- every node can go to every other node

Can also have weighted or unweghted graphs (cost associated with travelling 
edge)

Types of graphs: linked list: doubly is undirected, singly is directed


###Storing Graphs

Adjacency list: For each vertex, keep a list of all adjacent vertices (like lists 
hanging off a hash table)

Two-dimensional array: like a table of intersections, or a matrix

Cost of filling two-dimensional array: O(|V|^2) 

V is the set that contains vertices -- magnitude of V is the time

Cost of filling adjacency list: O(|E|+|V|)

For dense graph (lots of connections), |E| = THETA(|V|^2)

For sparse graph, |E| = O(|V|)

###Topological Sort

Indegree -- number of edges that point to a node

If indegree == 0, then you are a "starting" node only

Start with vertex of indegree 0, remove that thing, then decrement the indegree
 of all the vertices linked to that vertex

Or user enqueue / dequeue method (page 364 in book)
