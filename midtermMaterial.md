Things to know for the midterm:

* Know hash tables and their algorithms!!!
* prove by induction, eg the number of null links in a tree of a 
  given completeness
* Will do AVL rotations (there's one on homework 3)
* Do some coding, e.g. tree traversal, or stack, or queue
* Be familiar with BigO costs of algorithms
* Array-based implementation of priority queues

### Chapter 1: 

Generics

Induction proofs

Recursion

### Chapter 2:

BigO, BigTheta, BigOmega

### Chapter 3:

Anything is fair game, including implementations

### Chapter 4:

Section 1, implementation for trees, general purpose, binary, expression 
  trees, how building them involves stacks

Be careful about evaluatins postfix vs building tree on postfix expression

Binary search tree & BS condition

AVL trees, their coniditons, and the rotations

B-trees, might have short-answer question

### Chapter 5

Up to 5.4.2 (and familiar with 5.5)

How one determines table size

collision resolutions

deletions and inserts

quadratic / linear probing

rehashing

### Chapter 6

Through 6.3.3 (Heaps)
