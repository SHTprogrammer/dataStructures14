>>>Problem 1:

>>>Weiss, Exercise 1.15. For this problem you are creating a Rectangle 
>>>class as described in the problem. You are then going to create two
>>>implementations of Comparator on that Rectangle class: one that 
>>> compares by area, one that compares by perimeter. 
>>>You will then create a final class called Problem1 that contains 
>>>the findMax and main methods. 

Rectangle class is contained in Rectangle.java. 

The two comparators are AreaCompare.java and PerimCompare.java.

The final class that contains findMax and the tests is Problem1.

>>>Problem 2:

>>>Weiss Exercise 2.7, part b. Have your main method test the run times 
>>>for various values of N. Report your results in the written part of 
>>>the assignment.

The provided code for getting runtime is in TimeInterval.java.
The code fragments from the text are implemented in timeFragments.java,
and the testing of the runtime of these fragments occurs in timeTest.java.

>>>Problem 3:

>>>Implement a recursive binary search method. Create a class called Problem2
>>>that tests this method on several inputs. 

The recursive binary search method is in RecursiveBs.java. Testing of this
method occurs in Problem2.java.
