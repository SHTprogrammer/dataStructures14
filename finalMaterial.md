##Final exam review


###Chapter 1

Proofs, (n+1)/2 sum limit

--include induction proof

###Chapter 2

Basic rules of nested loops, divide and conquer

Ask for costs from algorithms, runtime alanysis, etc

###Chapter 3

Linked lists (single & double)

List iterators

Familiar with postfix expression vs. expression trees, evaluate and build

###Chapter 4

General purpose tree -- 4.1, icluding binary trees

Binary Search trees (left node smaller than node, right bigger)

Lazy delete

AVL trees - have to do rotations again

###Chapter 5

Hash functions - strategies for character arrays

bad examples--adding up ascii, etc

mod functions, collisions, collision resolution

load factor, 1/2 for quadratic probing

rehash (to next prime > *2 )

###Chapter 6

Min heap, max heap, percolate up, percolate down
 
6.1 - 6.3

###Chapter 7

Sorting, selection sort (not in book!)

insertion sort 

merge sort -- telescoping proof

quicksort

7.2, 7.4, 7.5-7.7

###Chapter 8

8.1, 8.2, 8.3

Disjoint sets

###Chapter 9

Dense and sparse graphs

topological sorts

shortest paths

weighted & unweighted

going to need to do djikstras algo by hand

P vs. NP
