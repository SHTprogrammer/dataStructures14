## Notes from Week 1, Day 2 (2014-07-10)

### Abstract Data Types (ADT)
Lists, Stacks, Queues, Interface (for example, collection)

#### Collections
--have no ordering
--using "iterable" interface must provide a method named iterator

>>>check extended for loops, which internally create iterator

#### List
--ordered
--extends collection (includes all the methods in collection)


inserting into a list:

    int[] arr = new int[10];
    int[] newarr = new int[11];
    for int i=0; i < r.length, i++){
      newarr[i] = arr[1];
    }
    arr = newarr;

--inserting is order N

finding an indexed element is order 1
removing an item could be order 1 (from end) or N (from beginning)

#### Simple Linked List
Items in list have next pointers until teh last element points to NULL

Size of linked list--must have locaiton of object, and pointer to next object
Order of making is still O(N), but factor is > 1 for all elements

Retrieving an element from a linked list:

    ListNode temp = a
    while(temp.next==null){
      //do whatever
      temp = temp.next;
    }

If linked list is NOT a doubly linked list (only has pointers going one way), then adding to end cost is O(n) 

Adding at the beginning is O(1)

Removals or additions are O(1) if you are already at the location

#### Doubly linked list

Adding to a DLL:
    temp = head.next; (to tail)
    head.next = new ListNode;
    head.next.prev = head;
    head.next.next = temp;
    head.next.next.prev = head.next;


Iterator type from java.util:

    public interface Iterator<AnyType>
    {
    boolean hasNext( );
    AnyType next( );
    void remove( );
    }

For a LL remove will be instant, but for an array it will be O(n). But if using iterator you cannot index jump on array, no there is no array benefit.

static-- means it hold for entire class
final--means cannot be changed


>>> confused by size vs. ensure capacity in MyArrayList.java

Inner classes can use the methods of the outer methods that invoke it
++ and -- behind a variable get incremented AFTER expression is evaluated
++ and -- before a variable get incremented BEFORE expression is evaluated

In order to GET a value, you must go past the value
Therefore, remove takes out the *previous* value

#### Stack ADT
Push -- add element to top of stack
Last thing you put in is the first thing you pull out (Last In, First Out, LIFO)
Pop -- take data off the top of the stack
Top/Peek -- tells you what the thing is on top, but doesn't remove
Methods: isEmpty, doClear, etc

Array-based implementation:
  Set top-of-stack to new value
  Pop just reassigns new value (constant time)
  However, doesn't keep track of number of things in stack, 
    so you could go over the amount of space (stack overflow)
  Don't have to preallocate space

Any ordered list can be turned into a stack

stack to verify palindromes?
Reverse Polish Notation, Checking Open/Close Brackets, etc
