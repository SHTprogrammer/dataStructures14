## Notes from Week 1, Day 2 (2014-07-10)

### Abstract Data Types (ADT)
Lists, Stacks, Queues, Interface (for example, collection)

#### Collections
--have no ordering
--using "iterable" interface must provide a method named iterator

>>>check extended for loops, which internally create iterator

#### List
--ordered
--extends collection (includes all the methods in collection)


inserting into a list:

    int[] arr = new int[10];
    int[] newarr = new int[11];
    for int i=0; i < r.length, i++){
      newarr[i] = arr[1];
    }
    arr = newarr;

--inserting is order N

finding an indexed element is order 1
removing an item could be order 1 (from end) or N (from beginning)

#### Simple Linked List
Items in list have next pointers until teh last element points to NULL

Size of linked list--must have locaiton of object, and pointer to next object
Order of making is still O(N), but factor is > 1 for all elements

Retrieving an element from a linked list:

    ListNode temp = a
    while(temp.next==null){
      //do whatever
      temp = temp.next;
    }

If linked list is NOT a doubly linked list (only has pointers going one way), then adding to end cost is O(n) 

Adding at the beginning is O(1)

Removals or additions are O(1) if you are already at the location

#### Doubly linked list

Adding to a DLL:
    temp = head.next; (to tail)
    head.next = new ListNode;
    head.next.prev = head;
    head.next.next = temp;
    head.next.next.prev = head.next;
